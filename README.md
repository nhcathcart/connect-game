# Command Line Connect Game

Command line Connect game written with Python3. Can be played with 2 players, or against an AI. Player can set the size of the board, and the number of stones that need to be connected for a win. The AI uses a minimax alogrithm with alpha beta pruning, and a simple evaluation function. Depth of the minimax algorithm is set to 6, so large board sizes will run quite slowly when playing against the AI.
